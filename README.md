# 🔥 FireWatch AI — Wildfire Early Threat Radar (Canada)

FireWatch AI is an **AI-ready wildfire monitoring and decision-support web application** designed to improve early awareness, preparedness, and emergency coordination across Canada.

The platform brings together **geospatial visualization**, **risk scoring**, **alert management**, and **public safety resources** into a single modern dashboard.

> ⚠️ This project currently uses simulated and static datasets to demonstrate architecture, UX, and system design. It is built to integrate real satellite, environmental, and emergency data sources.
